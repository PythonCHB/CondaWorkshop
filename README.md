# CondaWorkshop

Here is basic outline for PuPPy's Anaconda workshop. It'll be hands on so we'll work through installing conda, setting up environments and get a feel for conda usage.

In the meetup, ask what OS the participants will be using.

* Start with survey responses to motivate the content
* Plan for roughly 4 hours, hands on, workshop
